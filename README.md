# Tigo Music Website

Complete music website with a custom CMS created from scratch using CakePHP a rapid and robust PHP MVC framework. 
Millicom Ghana Limited (Tigo) is a mobile telecommunication services provider, which offers unlimited music streaming service through the Tigo Music Hub. 

Tigo Ghana partnered with Fifth Light Media to design and develop the Tigo Music Hub. This is a custom built website which is linked to the Deezer music streaming service to provide users access to Deezer’s music database as well as other music and video content.

## Responsive design

Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors).

The Tigo Music website design adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images. The custom design allows for less time spent working within the constraints of a system that doesn't fit the business needs, rather we spend more time creating something that allows the client to stand out from every other site out there.

## Custom CMS

We build websites that offers much higher performance, integration and extensibility than a pre-packaged CMS could offer out-of-the-box. The Tigo Music website is custom made from the frontend to the backend. The CMS is built according to the website specification not the other way round. 

Fifth Light Media CMS is built specific to the organization with the customization needed to give relevant features with a superior user experience. None of this would be possible in other open source systems without significant development resources. Our base engine that we build all our sites on has been tested, optimized and battle-tested in high-traffic sites.
